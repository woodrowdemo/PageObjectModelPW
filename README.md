## Features

- Built with C# and Playwright for reliable end-to-end browser automation.
- Implements the Page Object Model design pattern for scalable and maintainable tests.
- Simple and clear codebase for learning and extending.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0 SDK or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js (required by Playwright)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Playwright for .NET](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/woodrowdemo/PageObjectModelPW.git
    cd PageObjectModelPW
    ```

2. **Restore dependencies:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers:**
    ```bash
    pwsh bin/Debug/net6.0/playwright.ps1 install
    ```
    Or, if using bash:
    ```bash
    bash bin/Debug/net6.0/playwright.sh install
    ```

├── Utilities/          # Helper classes and utilities
├── PageObjectModelPW.csproj
└── README.md
```

## Usage

To run the sample tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```

You can add or modify tests in the `Tests/` folder, and add new page object classes in the `Pages/` folder following the POM pattern.
